# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
The Loan Eligibility Prediction project uses machine learning to classify applicants as eligible or not based on financial and demographic data, automating loan approvals for banks and improving decision-making efficiency.
## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
<br>
âœ… Develop a predictive model to classify applicants as eligible or not for a loan.
<br>
âœ… Perform data preprocessing by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
<br>
âœ… Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and correlations affecting loan approval.
<br>
âœ… Apply feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy and performance.
<br>
âœ… Train multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) and compare their performance.
<br>
âœ… Evaluate models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
<br>
âœ… Optimize the best-performing model through hyperparameter tuning to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Dataset used
<br>
- <a href="https://github.com/Madhu-D025/Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning/blob/main/loan_approval_dataset.csv">Dataset</a>

## Dataset Overview
<br>
âœ… Applicant Income â€“ The income of the primary loan applicant, which impacts repayment capability.
<br>
âœ… Coapplicant Income â€“ The income of a co-applicant (if any), which can boost loan approval chances.
<br>
âœ… Loan Amount â€“ The total loan amount requested by the applicant.
<br>
âœ… Loan Term â€“ The duration (in months) for which the loan is sanctioned.
<br>
âœ… Credit History â€“ A binary indicator (1 or 0) representing whether the applicant has a history of timely repayments.
<br>
âœ… Property Area â€“ The location category (Urban, Semi-Urban, or Rural) of the applicantâ€™s property.
<br>
âœ… Marital Status â€“ Indicates whether the applicant is married, which may influence eligibility.
<br>
âœ… Education Level â€“ Specifies whether the applicant is a graduate or not.
<br>
âœ… Self-Employed Status â€“ Identifies if the applicant is self-employed or working for a company.
<br>
âœ… Dependents â€“ The number of dependents financially supported by the applicant, affecting loan repayment ability.
<br>
âœ… Loan Status â€“ The target variable (Yes/No), indicating whether the loan was approved.
<br>
<br>
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
<br>
<br>
âœ… Handling missing values using imputation techniques.
<br>
âœ… Visualizing correlations between features and loan eligibility.
<br>
âœ… Detecting outliers using box plots.
<br>
âœ… Feature engineering for better model performance.
<br>

## Machine Learning Models Used
<br>
<br>
1) Logistic Regression
<br>
2) Decision Tree
<br>
3) K-Nearest Neighbors
<br>
4) Naive Bayes
<br>
5) SVM
<br>

## Model Evaluation Metrics
<br>
âœ… Accuracy Score
<br>
âœ… Precision, Recall, and F1-score
<br>
âœ… Confusion Matrix
<br>

## Conclusion
<br>
The Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy, making it the best-performing model for loan eligibility prediction. Other models like SVM, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, and Logistic Regression performed well but with slightly lower accuracy. The K-Nearest Neighbors model had a noticeable drop in testing accuracy, indicating potential overfitting. Overall, Decision Tree is the most reliable model for this dataset. ðŸš€
